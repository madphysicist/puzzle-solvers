This project has moved to GitLab: https://gitlab.com/madphysicist/puzzle-solvers. Please download the latest code and submit issues there rather than GitHub, which will no longer be monitored until this stale clone is deleted.

Puzzle Solvers is a small library containing tools for solving all kinds of
puzzles. Currently "all kinds" == "one kind", but who's counting?
